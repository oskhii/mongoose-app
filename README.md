# mongoose-app

This is my Node.js REST API project using Mongoose. The data added to the database is data of the most valuable football players in the world.

This app contains 5 routes: 
/getall and /:id  using get
/add using add
/update/:id using put
/delete/:id using delete

I have tested the app with Postman and I uploaded a YouTube video showing how the app works on Postman since Heroku wasn't possible to use.
